(separate notification daemon from irc connector
 (notification daemon should reconnect when necesary)
 (maybe there's an existing daemon to hook into, maybe write one from
  irc_notify_d.bash
  (scan for existing system daemons, start own if one can't be found)))
(use pidfiles generated with user@server.pid.$RANDOM
 (possibly use mktemp))
(trap INT TERM EXIT and properly kill subshells)
