(separate notification daemon from irc connector
 (maybe there's an existing daemon to hook into, maybe write one from
  irc_notify_d.bash
  (scan for existing system daemons, start own if one can't be found)))
(notification daemon should reconnect when necesary)

(trap INT TERM EXIT)
(kill local 'tail -f ~/.irssi/fnotify' with %1 or $! or something)
